이러한 관계를 찾아서 읽고 구현



### generalization

* is-a relationship
* Inheritance relationship
* Hollow triangle shape 아래 -|> 위


```
Generalization between classes
is-a relationship
Inheritance relationship
Customer  Person
From subclass
To superclass
Direction of generalization
Hollow triangle shape
Base class
Person
Leaf class
Park::Customer…
```


### Association

* has-a relationship
* ***Multiplicity*** 여러개 붙일 수 있다.

```
Association between classes
has-a relationship
Member variables
A customer has a number of holding accounts
An account has an account holder customer
Simple line
If a simple arrow is added
A customer has a reference to bank accounts
A bank account has a reference to a customer
Navigability
Line ends are tagged by roles
Account holder
Holding accounts
With prefix showing the visibiliy
+: public , -: private, #: protected
```


Multiplicity of Association


```
In computer science and engineering
* often means many
Hence,
1..*
1 to Many
*
0 to Many
Naturally
1
Exactly one
0..1
One or zero
If not specified, it means one
```

### Aggregation

Association 비슷하지만 다른

Family  FamilyMember   FamilyMember가 없으면 Family도 없다. 의존적

```
Special case of association
Special has-a relationship
More like, part-whole or part-of relationship
A family member is a part of a family
The existence of the family depends on the aggregation of the family member
If nothing to aggregate, there is no family

Aggregation often occur 
when an aggregating class is a collection class
When the collection class’s life cycle depends on the collected classes
```

### Dependency 

* use relationship
지역변수, 활용하고 사라질 때. 

```
Dependency between classes
use relationship
An engineer uses a calculator
May use for
Local variables
Method signatures
Parameter types
Method return types
Something that you import for the implementation

## Weekly Objectives


* This week, we learn the first set of data structures: linked list, stack, and queue.
* Objectives are
  * Understanding the definition of abstract data types
  * Firmly understanding how references work
  * Understanding various linked list, stack, and queue structures
    * Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list…
    * Able to implement a stack and a queue with a list
  * Understanding the procedures of linked list, stack, and queue management
    * Insert, delete, search…
    * Should be able to estimate the number of steps for inserts, deletes, and searches
